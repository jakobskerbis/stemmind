# Quality bar: lessons, tasks, simulations

j (2026-10-29): every lesson, task and simulation in STEMMind must be class-leading, i.e. better than
Khan Academy (worked examples, hints, mastery), Brilliant (active learning inside the lesson),
Photomath (step-by-step solutions), PhET (explorable sims with implicit scaffolding) and Desmos
(direct manipulation). English on purpose: agents read this file (see `docs/token-rules.md`).

Research behind the bar (short): worked examples then faded practice (Sweller, Renkl), retrieval
practice and spacing (Roediger & Karpicke, Cepeda), interleaving (Rohrer), feedback that names the
error, not just "wrong" (Hattie & Timperley, ASSISTments misconception feedback), self-explanation
(Chi), predict–observe–explain for sims (White & Gunstone, PhET design), multiple representations,
dual coding, concreteness fading. No "learning styles".

Each item is a check. "MUST" items are tested by a script where noted; reviewers check the rest.

## 1. Lessons (`content/lessons/**`, format in `content/lessons/README.md`)

Writers and reviewers: Opus (or Fable), never Sonnet. Checker: `node scripts/check-lesson.js -q`.

1. **MUST: correct.** Every number in worked examples recomputed (`node -e`), every quiz key checked, units and significant figures right, Slovenian terms of the school level (OŠ/SŠ/faks).
2. **MUST: right level.** Uses only what the path taught before (`previousSummaries`); goals from the curriculum are all covered.
3. **Zakaj** starts from something the student knows or sees (a concrete situation, a question), not from a definition.
4. **Razlaga** goes concrete → picture → symbols (concreteness fading). Every new term is defined at first use, in a short sentence. One idea per paragraph. For MAT/FIZ/KEM always at least one picture-like representation (table, number line, diagram described in words, or the simulation below).
5. **MUST: 2 "stop and think" checks inside Razlaga** (`:::premisli` block, see README): a short question the student answers in their head before reading on, answer hidden behind a button. Ask for a prediction or an explanation ("Kaj se zgodi, če …?", "Zakaj …?"), not a copy of the sentence above.
6. **Rešeni primeri: 3 examples, easy → hard,** each with Podatki / Iščemo / `:::formula` / numbered steps with intermediate results / answer in a sentence. Each step says *why*, not only *what* (one short clause). Example 3 is a transfer case (word problem, reverse question or two-step), not the same template with other numbers.
7. **Faded example:** the last example (or an extra "Primer 4 – zdaj ti") leaves the final 1–2 steps for the student, with the answer hidden in a `:::premisli` block.
8. **Pogoste napake:** 3–5 real misconceptions of this topic (not generic "be careful"), each with a wrong line of reasoning, why it is wrong, and the fix. These are the same misconceptions the quiz distractors use.
9. **Simulation:** Razlaga or an example says what to try in »simulacija spodaj« (one concrete instruction + what to notice), so the sim is used for a purpose.
10. **Preveri se: 5 questions** (minimum 3 is only the checker floor), mixed: 1 recall, 2 understanding, 2 application. Every wrong option is a real misconception and **MUST have its own `~` feedback line** (why a student picks it and what is wrong). The `>` line explains the correct answer.
11. **Drugače:** at least 2 alternatives that are really different (picture, everyday life, numbers step by step, more precise); not a rephrasing of Razlaga.
12. **Accessibility and phone:** no information only in colour; tables ≤ 4 columns (phone width); formulas short enough to fit 360 px or split over lines; descriptive link text.
13. **Length** 1300–2300 words (checker warns above 2800). Short sentences. Decimal comma. `avtor: AI`.

## 2. Tasks (code generators, `server/practice/generators/*.js`)

Generators are code (no API cost); they are written and reviewed by Opus too. Audit:
`node scripts/kakovost-nalog.js [prefix]`; correctness: `node scripts/preveri-generatorje.js [prefix]` must report 0 errors.

1. **MUST: coverage.** Every OŠ/SŠ/TEK topic has at least one generator, ideally two task types (e.g. compute + reverse, or compute + concept choice).
2. **MUST: correct answer** computed in code from the same rounded numbers shown in the text; `preveri-generatorje` passes for 40 seeds × 3 levels.
3. **Levels really differ:** L1 one step, numbers that are easy to handle; L2 two steps or a unit conversion or a short word problem; L3 multi-step, reverse question, or transfer to a new context. Not the same template with bigger numbers.
4. **Variety:** at least 8 different tasks per level over 24 seeds; real contexts (names from `NAMES`, everyday objects, lab situations); no repeated sentence for every task.
5. **MUST: every task has** `hint` (a strategy or first step, never the answer), `solution` (numbered steps, each on its own line, intermediate results, final value with unit), `data: { given, find }` for every word problem and every task with a formula, `formula` when a formula or rule is used. Rounding and unit are stated in the text.
6. **Misconception feedback:** number and fraction answers list 1–3 typical wrong results in `answer.mistakes: [{ value, why }]` (forgot the unit conversion, reciprocal, forgot ½, used diameter instead of radius, sign error, added instead of multiplied …). `why` names the likely error without giving the answer ("Si prostornino pretvoril v m³?"). Choice answers give `answer.why: [..]` with one line per option. The checker also detects generic errors itself (power of 10, sign, reciprocal).
7. **Choice tasks** only when the concept is qualitative; at least 3 options; every distractor is a real misconception; mixed with numeric tasks in the same topic.
8. **Hint ladder** works automatically from `data` → `formula` → `hint`; so these three must be in that order of help (data reminds, formula tells the tool, hint gives the first step).
9. **Phone:** text ≤ ~60 words, no table wider than 4 columns, answers typable on the phone keypad (no special symbols needed except units the keypad has).

## 3. Simulations (`public/sim/*.js`, catalog `public/sim/katalog.js`)

1. **MUST: every OŠ/SŠ/TEK topic has a sim** (test in `test/textbook.test.js`).
2. **MUST: fidelity** (PR #35): fixed scales from slider maximums, one force scale, real-time or labelled time scale, clipped arrows dashed and labelled. Every slider changes something visible.
3. **Purpose:** each sim has a `tryText` »Poskusi:« with a concrete question to answer by exploring (predict → try → explain), not "move the slider".
4. **Multiple representations** linked live: the picture, the numbers (readout) and, where it fits, a graph or an equation update together.
5. **Direct manipulation** where it makes sense (drag points, bodies, vectors), not only sliders.
6. **MUST: accessible:** every control has a label (`aria-label`), draggable handles are reachable with Tab and move with arrow keys, readouts are `aria-live`, no information only in colour, respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (no autoplay).
7. **MUST: phone:** works at 360 px width with no horizontal scroll, touch targets ≥ 36 px, dragging does not scroll the page.
8. **MUST: no errors** in the console when mounted, and a »Ponastavi« (reset) button returns to the start state.
9. Dark mode readable (colours from CSS variables, `palette(el)`).
